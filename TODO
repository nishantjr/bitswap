Done
====

- Implement basic mechanics of protocol and naive stratergy

TODO
====

- Implement a "clock"

  ```
  T1:Topology <~ #tick => #satisfyWants <~ #allocateBandwidth <~ T1:Topology <~ #tick
  ```

- Implment selfish strategy
- Implment tit-for-tat strategy

- Properties to verify:
  * Do all co-operating nodes get what they want?  -- Should be a simple LTL or Reachability clause.
  * Are "selfish" nodes punished?                  -- What does punished mean? Is punishing them important? Or
                                                      do we just want the network not to be affected too much
                                                      by them?
